## Project: Software Rasterizer
**Start Date:** December 11, 2025  
**Current Phase:** Core rasterization algorithms

### Daily Entries

#### December 11, 2025 - Initiation
**Today's Goal:** Environment setup and project planning during limited internet window.

**Progress:**
- Focusing on Bresenham's Line Algorithm 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm) 
and how it works

**Technical Decisions:**
1. Implementing from scratch in C++ (no graphics libraries)
2. ASCII output first → OpenGL comparison later
3. Starting with cube (8 vertices, 12 edges)

**Blockers:** 
- Internet access limited to 20-minute windows
- Need to find efficient offline C++ documentation

**Insights:**
- The perspective projection formula (x/z, y/z) assumes camera at origin looking along z-axis
- Bresenham's algorithm uses integer arithmetic only - important for optimization

I will finish the rest tomorrow, as it was a late start. Hopefully, I'll discipline myself for at least a month.

#### December 16

Wow, I haven't updated this for a few days. I couldn't get the commit to work because I was too unbothered to figure it out.

- Made Bresenham algorithm work with slopes <= 1 & >= -1.
- Negative values work, but it was mostly easy.
- Tomorrow: ???

#### December 17

I rewrote bresenham's algorithm, with this time knowing how it works. I never thought algebra would actually help me in coding, yet here we are.

For tomorrow, I will try and make a naive version of it working for all sectors.

#### December 19

I forgot to commit yesterday and I'm also one day off every commit. I guess I have to commit earlier than 9pm now. It works for slopes > 1 but not for negative numbers.

#### December 20

I made it work for all degrees. Later, I will try and make a rotating square or cube. Since I already know the matrix multiplications, I figure it probably wouldn't be that hard.

#### December 20 - UPDATE

Okay, it's hard. Probably because of my trash math skills and whatsoever, but I'm going to save this for tomorrow. I'll probably try and rewrite the rotation matrix or create a new function for it. It doesn't seem like gitignore is not working, but I'm stupid, so I probably did something wrong.
##### Update 2

Yeah, I did something wrong.

#### December 21

Finally! There is now a rotating cube on the screen. Now that I look at the square, it doesn't seem symmetrical. I will try to fix this.

#### December 24

It's been 2 days, but I'm moving to SDL3. I am also reimplementing it again to drill the algorithm in my head. Also, it turns out the reason why the square didn't seem symmetrical was because I divided the values then turned the float into an integer, which messed up the values. I probably won't do that again.

#### December 25

I have successfully imported the files into SDL2. I also created a class and header file for line handling. I don't know what I could do next. 
My next choices that I would like to do:
1. Raytracing
2. Triangle filling (I should probably do this)
3. OpenGL to Vulkan
4. Physics Engine

All of these are quite difficult but it seems kinda fun (not opengl though) So I'll probably learn how to fill out triangles.

On a side note, I also need to finish my rig in Blender so I can animate easier.

#### December 26
I'm trying to get colour interpolation to work so I can use the colours to make it look smoother, like in OpenGL. Also, I added a Dmoj page with some answers there, and currently I'm failing and I'm getting AC up till the 13th case. I want to try and do all Junior division questions before hitting Grade 9.

#### December 27
Well... I kinda am getting sidetracked over me trying to learn XML and Lua for a niche rhythm game called NotITG. I know my friends are gonna see this and will say something like "of course you were" and stuff. To other people, you should really check it out, because in my opinion, it's really cool and barely anybody plays it for such a visually appealling game. Not in UI terms, but the levels itself.

#### December 31

Oh my god... I got even more sidetracked over studying raytracing and simple arduino. I gotta lock in on the triangle.

#### January 2

Wow, it seems I messed up the code. I need to rewrite the SDL3 pixel drawing. I will need to dig deeper on how my previous code worked.

#### January 6

It's been 4 days... and I still can't get this trangle rasterization to work. I'm still going to work on this, as I did for every single day... I guess I'll finally push this in probably more than a week.

#### January 12

I've fixed it! It's been way too long and I basically failed on my discipline. I had forgotten an = sign for a loop and now it works. I forgot to account the fact that all the pixels that are going to make the line are in the bounding box's edge, which I forgot to tell the program to check as well. I can't believe a 2 week long bugtesting phase was because of this.
